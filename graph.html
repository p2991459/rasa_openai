His Music Mountain program tells the story of Bach&rsquo;s influence on Mozart, including Mozart&rsquo;s arrangement for string quartet of two fugues from Bach&rsquo;s Well Tempered Clavier, and his own Adagio and Fugue in C Minor for string quartet. This special program starts with Bach Keyboard Concerti in F Minor, BWV 1056, and E Major, BWV 1053, and concludes with the Mozart Piano Concerto #14 in E Flat Major, K. 449. What makes this program special is the fact that the three concerti will be performed in their chamber music versions, with a stellar string quintet composed of Nancy Wu and Kobi Malkin, violins, Jessica Thompson, viola, Raman Ramakrishnan, cello, and Leigh Mesh, double bass, all renowned artists and members of ensembles such as Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center, the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra, Ensemble Connect, and Daedalus Quartet.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong><a href="https://ci.ovationtix.com/36135/performance/11237410">Buy Tickets</a></strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Location</strong></p><p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.google.com/maps/search/?api=1&amp;query=Gordon+Hall%2C+Music+Mountain%2C+225+Music+Mountain+Road%2C+Falls+Village%2C+Connecticut+06031+United+States">Gordon Hall, Music Mountain<br />225 Music Mountain Road<br />Falls Village, Connecticut 06031</a></p>
